# self-hosted-box

The following is the manual detailing steps for self-hosting  Zion relay cluster on AWS.
Here is a video demo -> https://streamable.com/dc5hf3

## Requirements
1. macOS + ansible [Details](ops/ansible/README.md)
2. Github Account + relevant keys [Details](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 
   1. Generate github SSH keys [YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_KEY] 
   2. Put at

    ```
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.github
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.github.pub
    ```
     (EC2 will use this key in order to pull source from this repo.)

3. AWS Account + relevant keys
    1. Generate IAM User with administrator access, put into config (all.yml) below [YOUR_AWS_KEY] [YOUR_SECRET_KEY]
    2. Generate EC2 keypair in AWS console [YOUR_EC2_KEYPAIR_NAME]
    3. Put at

    ```
    ~/.ssh
    ```

## Initial Setup

1. Create ansible vars file ops/ansible/group_vars/all.yml (Ansible will use these values to set up your cluster)

```
aws_access_key: [YOUR_AWS_KEY]
aws_secret_key: [YOUR_AWS_SECRET]
aws_region: [YOUR_AWS_REGION]

key_name: [YOUR_EC2_KEYPAIR_NAME]
# obtainable in your AWS account
vpc_id: [YOUR_EC2_CLUSTER_ID]

# obtain here based on [YOUR_AWS_REGION]
# https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/
# bionic 18.04LTS hvm:ebs-ssd
ami_id: [YOUR_AMI_ID]

communities_host: communities.getzion.com
communities_host_staging: null

media_host: memes.getzion.com
media_host_staging: null

media_host_protocol: "https"
```

2. Create ops/ansible/playbooks/roles/zion/vars/.env (Ansible will use these values to setup your EC2 instances, relay docker container and lnd)
   
```
CONNECT_UI=true
```

[Use Reference](ops/ansible/playbooks/roles/play/tasks/main.yml)

3. Modify cluster parameters to reflect the relevant domain/subdomain where you plan accessing you Zion relay.
[cluster_configs](ops/ansible/playbooks/cluster_configs.yml) 


## Deploy Procedure
1. Deploy Cluster
```
./scripts/ansible.sh

Choose Option 1 start_cluster
```

2. Go to http://yourdomain.com:8888/ for your access key.

The following deploys a box without TLS access, use this at your own risk.
